Week 3 Project: Cinema

Functionality:
-Able to search for films by Title
-Autosearches above 3 letters (lazy option to be honest)
-Pagination for next 20 Results
-Infinite scrolling
-Able to call/view additional information via modal by clicking on divs

Visual Design
-Infinite loop video on landing
-Broadly responsive (including the modal)
-Simple Design
-Cursor and hover effects

Issues
-Spent Saturday trying to make some superfluous stuff work which failed and used up time.
-Lack of time means I spent no time on making functions pure or implementing BEM
-Lack of time meant I couldn't finish off Favourites - I think I would have got these working to a basic level
