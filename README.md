# Project Cinema

## A movie search engine powered by the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com) API.

---

### Getting started

- Search for a film.
- Tap to reveal more details.

### UX

- [ ] **Work using mobile first, that is create the mobile version first and add tablet and desktop versions after.**
- A mobile-first responsive design responsive that looks great at different screen widths
  <!-- - [ ] ~~Create an HTML page which should have a `form` at the top which contains a text input and a submit button. Below it should have a placeholder element for the returned results.~~
- [ ] ~~Use JavaScript to capture the `submit` event in your search form, extract the query string from the text input and use that to make an API call to the Open Movie Database API to search for films which match the query string using `fetch`. `console.log` the results~~
- [ ] ~~Display the data returned by the API including title, year and poster picture~~ -->

### Movie details

### Technology used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

#### Challenges and learnings

## TODO

<!-- - [ ] **Filter fetch results to show only movies** -->

- [ ] **Implement any feature you would find useful or interesting**

<!-- - [ ] **Implement pagination so that users can navigate between all movies in search results rather than just the first ten** -->

- [ ] **Include a screenshot of your app in the README.**

- [ ] **Explain functionality created, mention any outstanding issues and possible features you would include if you had more time**

### stretch goal - favourites

<!-- - [ ] Create a favourites list. It's up to you how you would add items to favourites. You could add a button or otherwise. Display a list of favourites somewhere on your page. -->

- [ ] Make the favourites list sortable. Add `up` and `down` buttons to your favourites which on click will move the result in relevant direction.

<!-- - [ ] Save favourites locally using `localStorage` so that favourites persist in browser after refresh. -->

## stretch goal - search preview

- [ ] Let's create a search preview. It should listen for change events on input events and submit a search request with current query string. Display the search preview results in an absolute positioned container just below the search box.

       Hint: You may want to kick of the searching after at least 3 characters have been typed.

### The brief

- We want to see great looking webpages that work well at all screen widths
- Your code should have consistent indentation and sensible naming
- Use lots of concise, reusable functions with a clear purpose
- Add code comments where it is not immediately obvious what your code does
- Your code should not throw errors and handle edge cases gracefully. For example not break if server fails to return expected results
- Use BEM methodology in your markup and CSS to style your page
- Try to use pure functions as much as possible, but keep in mind it will not be possible to make all functions pure.
