# MovieThing

MovieThing is a movie search engine, powered by the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com).

To search for a film, enter part or all of its title into the search box at top left and click "Go". A list of title matches will appear below. If there are more than 10, a navigation link to the next 10 will appear beneath.

Click on the title of a film to see details about it displayed in the panel below. If a film is important to you in some fashion, use the "Favorite" checkbox to put it in the list of your favorite movies, which appears at top right. It will be placed into the first empty slot, and you can move it up and down or remove it using the icons that appear alongside.
