When finished, include a README.md in your repo. Someone who is not familiar with the project should be able to look at it and understand what it is and what to do with it. Explain functionality created, mention any outstanding issues and possible features you would include if you had more time. List technologies used to create the app. Include a screenshot of your app in the README.

This app is a movie search engine. It has been created using HTML, Javascript and CSS. The app takes a string as a search parameter, which is then passed to the searchMovie function along with a page number, and returns results according to those arguments.

The results are generated via API, which when fetched is converted to JSON, after which the relevant information is taken, placed in HTML tags, and appended onto the page.

If i had more time I would have liked to have finished adding a favourites list and have completed the search preview.
